loophole: placing A,B at nth or 26th position in matrix rowise and ith postion columwise, sort help alot, 

Each string in votes represents a ranking order given by a voter. The first character has the highest rank, the second has the second-highest rank, and so on.

For example:

votes = {"ABC", "ACB", "BCA"}

Each character represents a team:

"ABC": A is preferred over B, B over C.

"ACB": A over C, C over B.

"BCA": B over C, C over A.


The function aims to determine the overall ranking by prioritizing:

1. Higher vote counts for a better position.


2. Lexicographical order as a tiebreaker.

Step-by-Step Breakdown

Step 1: Initialize a Count Matrix

vector<vector<int>> count(26, vector<int>(27));

Creates a 26 x 27 matrix (count).

count[i] stores vote counts for team i (where i = 'A' - 'Z').

count[i][j] represents how many times team i was voted at position j.

count[i][26] stores the teamâ€™s character for sorting.


Step 2: Assign Team Letters to the Count Matrix

for (char& c: votes[0])
    count[c - 'A'][26] = c;

The first vote list determines the participating teams.

Example for "ABC":

count['A' - 'A'][26] = 'A'
count['B' - 'A'][26] = 'B'
count['C' - 'A'][26] = 'C'


Step 3: Count the Votes

for (string& vote: votes)
    for (int i = 0; i < vote.length(); ++i)
        --count[vote[i] - 'A'][i];

The ranking is stored as negative values for easier sorting (since we want a higher rank to be preferred).

The negative count helps when sorting because lower values will be placed first.


Example After Processing Votes: | Team | 1st Place | 2nd Place | 3rd Place | Letter | |------|----------|----------|----------|--------| | A    | -2       | -1       | -0       | 'A'    | | B    | -1       | -1       | -1       | 'B'    | | C    | -0       | -1       | -2       | 'C'    |

Step 4: Sort the Count Matrix

sort(count.begin(), count.end());

Since the votes are stored as negative numbers, sorting ensures that the team with the most 1st place votes comes first, then 2nd place votes, and so on.

If votes are equal, lexicographical order (team letter) acts as a tiebreaker.


Step 5: Construct the Result String

string res;
for (int i = 0; i < votes[0].length(); ++i)
    res += count[i][26];

The first N sorted teams (where N = votes[0].length()) are used to build the result string.

Visualization with Example Input

votes = {"ABC", "ACB", "BCA"}

Initial Count Matrix

A: [ 0, 0, 0, ..., 'A' ]
B: [ 0, 0, 0, ..., 'B' ]
C: [ 0, 0, 0, ..., 'C' ]

After Counting Votes

A: [-2, -1,  0, ..., 'A']  // 2 first places, 1 second place
B: [-1, -1, -1, ..., 'B']  // 1 first, 1 second, 1 third
C: [ 0, -1, -2, ..., 'C']  // 1 second, 2 third places

After Sorting

A: [-2, -1,  0, ..., 'A']
B: [-1, -1, -1, ..., 'B']
C: [ 0, -1, -2, ..., 'C']

Final Output

res = "ACB"

Summary

Stores rankings as negative values for easier sorting.

Uses sorting to prioritize higher votes and lexicographical order.

Extracts the top teams in ranked order to construct the result string.
